Illumina is a tracker designed for use with the Final Fantasy VI Worlds Collide Open World Randomizer!  This tool was designed to assist runners both experienced and new. Features currently include Character, Esper, Dragon, and Check trackers. You can also search bosses to get their weaknesses or rages to get their effects. The tracker is also customizable, allowing the user to enable and disable certain features as they see fit, and adjust the appearance. Custom characters are also supported! (though not all of them)
